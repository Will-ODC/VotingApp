        <h2>A New Model for Community Ownership</h2>
        <p>The ODC is a democratic platform where <strong>you</strong> control how your data is used and how community resources are allocated. Unlike traditional platforms that profit from your data, we're building a community-owned cooperative that puts wellbeing first.</p>

        <h3>How We're Funded</h3>
        <p>The ODC operates on a sustainable, transparent model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Member Donations</strong> - Like Wikipedia, members who can contribute help support the platform</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Partnerships</strong> - When companies want community feedback, members can voluntarily participate and proceeds go to the community fund</li>
            <li><strong>No Hidden Data Mining</strong> - We will NEVER sell your data without your explicit consent</li>
        </ul>
