Summary: MVP Feature Priorities & Launch Strategy
Most Urgent Features (Before First Poll)
1. Poll Type Distinction
o Add field: Initiative (executable) vs Opinion (discussion only)
o Visual indicators (different colors/badges)
o Only "Initiative" type requires executor commitment
2. Executor Commitment System
o Add "Who will execute this?" field to poll creation
o Checkbox: "I commit to executing this initiative"
o Display executor clearly on poll cards
3. Evidence Documentation
o Add evidence_url field for post-execution proof
o Simple text field for external links (Google Photos, Imgur)
o Delay image hosting to Phase 2 (use multer later)
Launch Strategy
Key Insight: One-time donations to established charities work well for MVP - clear proof, professional photos, immediate credibility.
Monthly Rhythm:
* Week 1-3: Vote on initiatives
* Week 4: Implementation detail polls (Opinion type)
* Next month, Week 1: Execute winning initiative
* Week 2: Share evidence and impact report
Implementation Flow
1. Initiative wins ? Executor notified
2. Follow-up polls for implementation details (as Opinion polls)
3. Execute based on community input
4. Document with photos/receipts via URL
5. Share impact publicly (no login required)
What to Defer
* Complex image hosting (use URLs initially)
* In-person verification (Phase 2)
* Skill trading features (Phase 5+)
* Email system (collect addresses, implement later)
Founder Participation
* Months 1-2: Exclude yourself from options (build trust)
* Month 3+: Can include genuine community service offerings
* Be transparent if you submit an option
* Never advocate for your own option
Core Principle
You have most features needed already. Add the three urgent features above and launch. Everything else can evolve based on what you learn from real usage. Don't over-engineer - start simple and iterate.
