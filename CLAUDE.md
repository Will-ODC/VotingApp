# VotingApp - Development Documentation

## Project Overview
An Online Democratic Community (ODC) platform that enables transparent, community-controlled decision-making and ethical data monetization for collective wellbeing. Built as a Node.js web application using Express.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS templating.

## üéØ Current Status (December 29, 2024)
**‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY** - Live at [www.onlinedemocracy.org](https://www.onlinedemocracy.org)

- **Platform**: Railway.app with PostgreSQL database, SSL/HTTPS, secure session management
- **All Systems Operational**: Authentication, polls, voting, action initiatives, profiles, contact system
- **Latest Enhancement**: Dynamic carousel with inline voting and real-time results
- **Current Focus**: Community engagement and feature expansion based on user feedback

### ODC Vision
- **Core Mission**: Create a democratic platform where users control how their data is used and monetized, with all proceeds funding community-chosen wellbeing initiatives
- **Funding Model**: Hybrid approach combining Wikipedia-style donations with voluntary corporate data partnerships (where users explicitly opt-in to share feedback)
- **Target Community**: Initial focus on 1,000 committed users in specific niches (e.g., privacy advocates, local governance, sustainable living)
- **Key Differentiator**: Not another social media platform, but a community research cooperative that uses democratic technology for collective benefit

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced schema supporting two-stage approval
- **Frontend**: EJS templates with embedded CSS

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Best Practices

### Modular Task Decomposition
When implementing new features, always break them down into smaller, manageable components:

1. **Analyze the Feature Requirements**
   - Identify core functionality vs. nice-to-have elements
   - Map dependencies and integration points
   - Define clear success criteria for each component

2. **Create Subtasks for Implementation**
   - Database schema changes (if needed)
   - Backend API endpoints
   - Frontend UI components
   - Integration and testing
   - Documentation updates

3. **Delegate to Specialized Agents**
   - Use Sonnet subagents for focused implementation tasks
   - Assign database work to agents specialized in PostgreSQL
   - Delegate UI work to agents with frontend expertise
   - Utilize testing agents for comprehensive test coverage

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create detailed task breakdown in todo list
   - Identify which components can be developed in parallel
   - Determine integration points and dependencies

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Implement one component at a time
   - Test each component independently before integration
   - Use incremental commits with clear messages
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Combine components systematically
   - Test integrated functionality thoroughly
   - Handle edge cases and error scenarios
   - Optimize performance where needed

### Clean Code Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/module should do one thing well
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common functionality into reusable components
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files
- **Consistent Style**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **Comments**: Explain WHY, not WHAT (the code shows what)

### Working with Subagents
When delegating tasks to Sonnet subagents:

1. **Provide Clear Context**
   - Share relevant code snippets
   - Explain the current architecture
   - Define expected outcomes

2. **Set Boundaries**
   - Specify which files can be modified
   - Identify dependencies to preserve
   - Clarify performance requirements

3. **Review and Integrate**
   - Test subagent implementations thoroughly
   - Ensure consistency with existing code
   - Refactor if needed for better integration

### Example: Implementing Email Notifications
```
Main Task: Add email notification system

Breakdown:
1. Database: Add notification preferences table (Delegate to DB specialist)
2. Email Service: Integrate email provider (Delegate to integration specialist)
3. API: Create preference endpoints (Delegate to backend specialist)
4. UI: Build notification settings page (Delegate to frontend specialist)
5. Queue: Implement email queue system (Delegate to systems specialist)
6. Testing: Create comprehensive tests (Delegate to testing specialist)

Integration: Combine all components and ensure smooth operation
```
