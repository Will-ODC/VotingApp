# Timezone Conversion Test Summary

## Overview
The timezone conversion implementation has been thoroughly tested and is working correctly. The system properly converts date picker inputs to 11:59:59 PM PST/PDT for poll expiration.

## Test Results

### ✅ Core Functionality (PASSED)
- Date strings from the date picker (YYYY-MM-DD format) are correctly converted to end of day PST/PDT
- The conversion properly handles both PST (winter) and PDT (summer) time zones
- All dates are stored in UTC format in the database
- Display functions correctly show the dates in PST/PDT

### ✅ Key Findings

1. **Date Picker Input**: `2025-07-15`
   - **Stored in DB (UTC)**: `2025-07-16T06:59:59.000Z`
   - **Display in PST**: `2025-07-15 23:59:59`
   - **Correct**: ✅ Yes - This is 11:59:59 PM PDT on July 15th

2. **Winter Date**: `2025-12-25`
   - **Stored in DB (UTC)**: `2025-12-26T07:59:59.000Z`
   - **Display in PST**: `2025-12-25 23:59:59`
   - **UTC Offset**: 8 hours (PST is UTC-8)

3. **Summer Date**: `2025-07-15`
   - **Stored in DB (UTC)**: `2025-07-16T06:59:59.000Z`
   - **Display in PDT**: `2025-07-15 23:59:59`
   - **UTC Offset**: 7 hours (PDT is UTC-7)

### ✅ Database Integration (PASSED)
- Dates are stored correctly in PostgreSQL as UTC timestamps
- Expiration queries work properly using `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- Time calculations (hours until expiry) are accurate

### ✅ Edge Cases Handled
- Daylight Saving Time transitions are handled automatically
- Invalid date inputs throw appropriate errors
- Past and future dates are correctly identified for expiration

## Implementation Details

### Key Functions:
1. **`convertToPSTEndOfDay(dateString)`**
   - Takes a YYYY-MM-DD string
   - Returns ISO string representing 11:59:59 PM PST/PDT
   - Handles DST automatically

2. **`formatDateTimeToPST(date)`**
   - Formats any date to PST/PDT for display
   - Shows correct local Pacific time

3. **`isDateInPastPST(date)`**
   - Correctly determines if a poll has expired

### Poll Creation Flow:
1. User selects date: `2025-07-15`
2. System converts to: `2025-07-16T06:59:59.000Z` (UTC)
3. Stores in database as UTC timestamp
4. Displays to users as: `July 15, 2025 11:59:59 PM PDT`
5. Expiration check compares UTC time with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

## Conclusion
The timezone conversion implementation is fully functional and ready for production use. Polls will expire at the correct time (11:59:59 PM Pacific Time) regardless of daylight saving time.
