# VotingApp - Development Documentation

## Project Overview
An Online Democratic Community (ODC) platform that enables transparent, community-controlled decision-making and ethical data monetization for collective wellbeing. Built as a Node.js web application using Express.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS templating.

## üéØ Current Status (June 19, 2025)
**‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY** - Live at [www.onlinedemocracy.org](https://www.onlinedemocracy.org)

- **Phase 0**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Production deployment successful with Action Initiative system  
- **Next Phase**: **Phase 1** - Foundation features and controlled community growth
- **Current Focus**: Community engagement with Action Initiatives and user contribution tracking
- **Technical Status**: Stable PostgreSQL deployment with two-stage approval system
- **Platform**: Railway.app with PostgreSQL database, SSL/HTTPS, secure session management
- **All Systems**: ‚úÖ Authentication, polls, voting, action initiatives, profiles, contact system operational

### ODC Vision
- **Core Mission**: Create a democratic platform where users control how their data is used and monetized, with all proceeds funding community-chosen wellbeing initiatives
- **Funding Model**: Hybrid approach combining Wikipedia-style donations with voluntary corporate data partnerships (where users explicitly opt-in to share feedback)
- **Target Community**: Initial focus on 1,000 committed users in specific niches (e.g., privacy advocates, local governance, sustainable living)
- **Key Differentiator**: Not another social media platform, but a community research cooperative that uses democratic technology for collective benefit

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced schema supporting two-stage approval
- **Frontend**: EJS templates with embedded CSS
- **Authentication**: Session-based with middleware
- **File Structure**: MVC pattern with routes, models, views, middleware
